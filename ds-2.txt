Assignment 2: Write a program to implementing and evaluating a Logistic Regression 
model.
 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix 
# Load dataset from CSV file 
df = pd.read_csv('log.csv') 
# Assuming the last column is the target variable  
X = df.iloc[:, :-1] 
y = df.iloc[:, -1] 
# Split dataset into train and test sets 
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) 
# Standardize features 
scaler = StandardScaler() 
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) 
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test) 
# Train Logistic Regression model 
model = LogisticRegression() 
model.fit(X_train, y_train) 
# Make predictions 
y_pred = model.predict(X_test) 
# Evaluate the model 
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) 
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred) 
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred) 
# Print evaluation results 
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}') 
print('Confusion Matrix:') 
print(conf_matrix) 
print('Classification Report:') 
print(report)
